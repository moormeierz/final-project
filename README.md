Data: http://www.seanlahman.com/baseball-archive/statistics/

The goal of this application is to predict starting pitcher's salary.
The first step was to get the data down to 2010-2016 starting pitchers that pitched at least 10 starts in a given year.
This data was put through a random forest machine learning model to determine which statistics impact salary the most.  Strikeouts, Opponent Batting Average, and ERA were the most important statistics.
